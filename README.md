This project is a Rust implementation of an **Extractable Witness Encryption for KZG Commitments** scheme.

It is based on the following paper:
- [Extractable Witness Encryption for KZG Commitments
and Efficient Laconic OT](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/264.pdf).

An excellent overview is available here:
